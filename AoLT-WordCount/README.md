# Word Count Algorithm

## What is this?
A small project for a NLP lecture Algorithm of Language Technology. The task was simply to implement an n-gram (sequence of n words) counter
that outputs the 20 most frequent n-grams of a given training set. Efficient data structure had to be used due to the size of the training/test sets.
