# Automatic Text Summarizer

## What is this?
A project I did for an NLP lecture Foundations of Language Technology. The assignment was to implement an automatic single text summarizer.
The text summary should contain actual sentences from the original text, not generate new sentences (which is a much harder task).

# How does it work?
The approach I implemented is based on the TextRank paper, which itself is a derivation from the PageRank algorithm.
