      " Traveling to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia in what the White House pointed out was Trump’ s first official act in office, Trump stood before the agency’ s memorial to its dead officers and delivered an often self- referential and highly political speech that included an untruthful claim that his inauguration was better attended than those of Barack Obama.\n",
      "~~ System Summary ~~\n",
      " It is exactly the opposite,” Trump said, adding:“ I love you, I respect you, there is nobody I respect more.” Trump suggested that“ sometimes you haven’ t always gotten the backing” from the White House, suggesting Obama had“ restrained” the agency, and said to laughter and applause:“ You’ re going to say,‘ Please don’ t give us so much backing.’”\n",

      " More than 1 million people gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Trump.\n",
      " What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecedented international rebuke of a new president that packed cities large and small— from London to Los Angeles, Paris to Park City, Utah, Miami to Melbourne, Australia.\n",
      "~~ System Summary ~~\n",
      "“ No matter what anyone tells her, especially as a black woman in America.” The Washington demonstration was amplified by gatherings around the world, with march organizers listing more than 670 events nationwide and overseas in cities including Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Mexico City, Berlin and Yellowknife in Canada’ s Northwest Territories, where the temperature was 6 degrees below zero.\n",
      " Among the thousands of signs that marchers dumped at the end of the day in front of the Trump International Hotel, just blocks from his new home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.:“ P--- y Power” and“ This P--- y Bites Back.” Protesters got as close as they could to the presidential mansion, crowding metal barriers less than a block away as police and Secret Service personnel watched closely.\n"
